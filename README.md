Theme:
Same but different


Ideas:

- Different controls
  - Keyboard controls camera
  - Mouse controls movement  

- Ballroom
  - Find the different ball
  
- Two identical rooms except one small difference
  - Click on item missing to go to next level

- Room of shapes
  - Matching shapes and color to "holes in the wall" to move to next level
  
- Contradicting game design
  - Gather and collect spikes/lava
  - Avoid gold/grass


Scope:
